#Project description
This project is the second project of ITMD 565. It is an application developed in JavaScript, with the angular JS seed from Web Storm. It is also using bootstrap template. The user basically can add, edit, delete a menu. A menu is being composed of optional appetizers and drinks, an entrée (mandatory), optional wine and mandatory dessert. The user is also asked to write an author name. Random numbers are created to express likes and dislikes of the submitted menus.

#Development environment
I am on Windows 10, I used Web Storm 2016.1.1 to develop this project. I used angular JS 1.5.5.

#Installation instructions
There is no special instruction. To see the app running, you should just open the index.html with your favorite browser. You should be sure that your browser supports Indexed DB. You might want to open the project in Web Storm and run it from there, if you don’t the populate script (3 menus) will be run as many times as you launch the app and could annoy you. If you just run it from the explorer it will work too, but with the repetition of menus per launch.
